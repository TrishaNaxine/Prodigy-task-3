A **password complexity checker** is a tool that evaluates a password to ensure it meets security criteria like minimum length, inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, helping to prevent weak or easily guessable passwords.

Password Complexity Checker (Description)
This script evaluates the strength of a given password based on five key criteria:

Minimum length of 8 characters

Inclusion of uppercase letters

Inclusion of lowercase letters

Inclusion of digits

Inclusion of special characters

Based on how many of these rules are met, it assigns a strength level:
Very Weak, Weak, Moderate, Strong, or Very Strong.

If any criteria are missing, it gives feedback to help improve the password.
